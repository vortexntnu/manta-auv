## Motion launch
This package is a container for the launch file that launches every required node in the 'motion' category.
The same nodes are utilized by both the simulator and the physical AUV, with the exception of the MCU interface node.
The motion.launch file is launched by the top-level launchfile in the auv_setup package.
