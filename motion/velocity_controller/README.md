# Velocity Controller

A velocity controller using six one-dimensional PIDs with feed-forward term and integral windup protection. The control law includes compensation for restoring forces. 

This package uses [MiniPID](https://github.com/tekdemo/MiniPID) as PID implementation. 

A max setpoint range is used instead of a reference model. This might lead to less optimal performance, but it will most likely be good enough.
