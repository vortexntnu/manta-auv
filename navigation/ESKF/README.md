# Error State Kalman Filter

State estimator that estimates position, orientation (quaternions) and linear velocities by comparing double integrations of IMU measurements with DVL mesurements. 

## Inputs and Outputs

Publishes

- ESKF/pose (nav_msgs::odometry)
- BiasAndGravity (nav_msgs::odometry)
- nis_dvl (nav_msgs::odometry)
- nis_pressureZ (nav_msgs::odometry)

Subscribes to 

- IMU (sensor_msgs::Imu)
- Depth (std_msgs/Float64)
- DVL twist (geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovarianceStamped)

## Setup instructions

### Launch

can be found in apps/ros/launch

See Overwater_30_min_test.launch for a good example.

output="screen" will print all internal prints as well as those from ROS.  
clear_params="true": important. Clears all previous params with the same names.
